# DevExtreme DataGrid Example: How To Retrieve Data From GraphQL

This example demonstrates how to use GraphQL data sources with DevExtreme. It consists of a server application and a client application.

## Server app

The [/server](/server/) folder contains an Express.js application. The application's GraphQL API serves plain JSON data from the [/data](/data/) folder.

Install server dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

Launch the server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Client app

The [/client/vite-react](/client/vite-react/) folder contains a Vite.js application with a React.js front end. It displays a DataGrid component that queries the server's GraphQL API.

Enter the folder to install client dependencies:

```shell
cd client/vite-react; npm i
```

Launch the application:

```shell
npm run dev:client
```

Open the Vite application in the browser to see the DataGrid in action.
